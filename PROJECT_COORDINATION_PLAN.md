**Mitigation**: Database transactions, proper locking mechanisms

### Technical Risks  
**Risk**: WebSocket connection drops during critical operations
**Mitigation**: Auto-reconnection logic, state synchronization

**Risk**: Database connection failures
**Mitigation**: Connection pooling, retry mechanisms, graceful degradation

### Regulatory Compliance Risks
**Risk**: Gambling/lottery regulation violations
**Mitigation**: Compliance documentation, transparent rules, audit trails

**Risk**: Data privacy violations (GDPR, etc.)
**Mitigation**: Minimal data collection, secure storage, user consent
